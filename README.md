# 💼 Adeel Naeem | AI Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal AI portfolio website! This site showcases who I am, what I do, and some of the exciting AI and ML projects I've worked on during my academic journey.

> 🧠 Fun fact: I used ChatGPT to help style the website with CSS — because I'm an AI engineer, not a web designer! 😄
